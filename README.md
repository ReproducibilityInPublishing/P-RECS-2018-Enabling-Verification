# Enabling the Verification of Computational Results

We conducted an experiment on the computational physics community to measure 1) how frequently authors shared their code and data directly in their article; 2) Whether authors who didn't would respond to a request for code and data; 3) How far a user skilled in computation, but not an expert in the field could get with the materials received.

[`procedures_and_descriptions/methodology.md`](procedures_and_descriptions/methodology.md) is a description of our research methodology.

[`procedures_and_descriptions/column_descriptions.md`](procedures_and_descriptions/column_descriptions.md) is a description of the columns in our data format.

[`data/JCP_Dataset.csv`](data/JCP_Dataset.csv) an anonymized database of our findings which can be used to get the statistics we report in our article.

[`scripts/PRECSNumbers.py`](scripts/PRECSNumbers.py) a script to produce the reported numbers from the included database

[`scripts/run.sh`](scripts/run.sh) a script to run the numbers analysis of the database.
